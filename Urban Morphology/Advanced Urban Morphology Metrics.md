# üèôÔ∏è Advanced Urban Morphology Metrics
This guide outlines essential and advanced metrics for analyzing urban form and structure, going beyond traditional building-level indicators to include network and land-use considerations.

## üèôÔ∏è Urban Density and Land-Use Intensity

- **Floor Area Ratio (FAR)**  
  *Definition:* The ratio of a building‚Äôs total floor area to the area of the plot on which it is built.  
  *Use:* Indicates overall density and helps in understanding the intensity of land use.

- **Building Coverage Ratio (BCR)**  
  *Definition:* The proportion of land area covered by building footprints relative to the total plot area.  
  *Use:* Reflects open space availability and urban density.

- **Plot Ratio / Dwelling Density**  
  *Definition:* Number of dwelling units per unit of land area.  
  *Use:* Useful in residential area planning and assessing housing density.

## üß± Block-Level and Urban Form Metrics

- **Block Size and Perimeter-Area Ratio**  
  *Definition:* Measures such as block area, average block size, or the ratio of block perimeter to area that assess the compactness and configuration of urban blocks.  
  *Use:* Valuable for identifying patterns of urban sprawl versus compact urban form.

- **Fractal Dimension**  
  *Definition:* Quantifies the complexity of urban form by analyzing the fractal characteristics of the urban fabric.  
  *Use:* Helps in understanding the scale-invariant complexity of urban patterns.

- **Open Space Ratio / Built-Up Ratio**  
  *Definition:* The proportion of open (non-built) space relative to built space within urban blocks.  
  *Use:* Indicates the balance between development and green/open space.

- **Street Pattern Regularity**  
  *Definition:* Metrics such as the ratio of regular (grid-like) versus irregular street patterns.  
  *Use:* Informs urban legibility and navigation performance.

## üõ£Ô∏è Street Network and Accessibility Metrics

- **Centrality Measures (Space Syntax)**  
  *Definition:* Integration, connectivity, and control values derived from space syntax analyses to measure how street layouts support movement.  
  *Use:* Important to assess pedestrian and vehicular movement potentials and urban vitality.

- **Betweenness and Closeness Centrality**  
  *Definition:* Network measures that quantify the importance of nodes in terms of the role they play in connecting different parts of the network.  
  *Use:* Can indicate potential congestion nodes or areas with high accessibility.

- **Intersection Density & Junction Type Ratio**  
  *Definition:* Beyond basic intersection density, also includes the ratio of four-way intersections to three-way intersections.  
  *Use:* Assesses quality of the street network for active transportation.

## üè¢ Vertical Morphology and Urban Form Composition

- **Building Height and Elevation Variation**  
  *Definition:* Statistical measures (mean, variance) of building heights.  
  *Use:* Critical for understanding vertical form and its impact on microclimates (e.g., sun/shadow, wind).

- **Sky View Factor (SVF)**  
  *Definition:* Derived from remote sensing or photogrammetry, indicates the openness of the urban canopy.  
  *Use:* Common in urban heat island and outdoor comfort analysis.

## üß≠ Land Use Diversity and Functional Mix

- **Shannon‚Äôs Diversity Index for Land Use**  
  *Definition:* Measures the diversity of land use types within a defined area.  
  *Use:* Provides insight into the mix of residential, commercial, and industrial uses.

- **Integration/Segregation Indices**  
  *Definition:* Metrics that evaluate how well different land uses are spatially integrated or segregated.

## üîÑ Additional Considerations

- **Urban Permeability / Porosity**  
  *Definition:* Measures how ‚Äúopen‚Äù or ‚Äúpenetrable‚Äù the urban fabric is for movement and circulation.

- **Average Street Width and Sidewalk Ratio**  
  *Definition:* Assesses the built environment‚Äôs allocation for pedestrians vs. vehicles.

- **Temporal Dynamics**  
  *Definition:* Incorporates time-based metrics (e.g., seasonal variations in occupancy or traffic) using time-series or sensor data.
