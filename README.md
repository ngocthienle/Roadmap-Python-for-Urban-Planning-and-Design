# Roadmap Python for Urban Planning and Design
 This is the roadmap for learning Python for Urban Planning and Design


🗺️ Geospatial Analysis and GIS
These are essential for working with spatial data—core to urban planning.

geopandas – For handling and analyzing geospatial vector data (shapefiles, GeoJSON, etc.).

shapely – For geometric operations (e.g., buffering, intersections, etc.).

fiona – For reading/writing spatial data (used under the hood by geopandas).

pyproj – For coordinate reference system (CRS) transformations.

rasterio – For reading and writing raster datasets (e.g., satellite images).

osmnx – For downloading, analyzing, and visualizing street networks and other OSM data.

folium / ipyleaflet – For interactive web maps in Jupyter Notebooks.

cartopy – For map projections and plotting geospatial data (good for more complex cartography).

contextily – For adding basemaps to geopandas plots.

movingpandas – For analyzing trajectory data (e.g., GPS tracks of people or vehicles).
